- This framework provides a basic implementation for Appium based Android/ iOS tests using the latest Appium Client v8.x.x and Server 2.x.x
- This could be used as the initial starter-kit to evolve into a full-fledged framework
- Multiple stand-alone test examples have been added to understand different functionalities

### Component functions:

**Tests**
* Tests defining the user actions based on business workflow
* Assertions based on the expected outcomes

**Tasks**
* Combining multiple actions to workflow
* Tests should use tasks
* Return type for assertion

An intermediate layer to combine multiple page interactions in a user-flow. 
These can be modularized to have re-usability across the tasks. 
If a single page has multiple workflows then we should create page-wise tasks else we should try and combine them to define it as user actions.

**Pages**
* Locators to identify the elements
* Methods to interact with Elements on page
